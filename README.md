## Book Collection Manager
My website is a book collection manager. The user inputs the title, author, publication year, genre, and ranking (from 1-5 stars). My derivied field uses the authors field and ranking field. 
It counts the number of stars an author has and scores the books from the amount of stars an author has. If their are ties both get the same position.
You can delete an entry from inserting a title of a book in the table.
I used CSS class selectors (examples field, message, box, result)
I used CSS ID selectors (options)
I used CSS Element selectors (header,h2,h3, p,input,button, table)
There are fonts for all the texts displayed on the website
