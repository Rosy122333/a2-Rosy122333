## Book Collection Manager
My website is a book collection manager. The user inputs the title, author, publication year, genre, and ranking (from 1-5 stars). My derivied field uses the authors field and ranking field. 
It counts the number of stars an author has and scores the books from the amount of stars an author has. If their are ties both get the same position.
You can delete an entry from inserting a title of a book in the table.

I used CSS class selectors (examples field, message, box, result)
I used CSS ID selectors (options)
I used CSS Element selectors (header,h2,h3, p,input,button, table)
There are fonts for all the texts displayed on the website
I didn't do CSS grid or flexbox for layout because I already used table and it looked good in my opinion



## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
- Using a combination of coumication through server.js and main.js. I have the table updating when adding and deleting and when the page is loading. I made a function displayer which is called quite often in main.js.
- You can modify exsisting data by entering the row and column and new entry it should be. I made a function in main.js called "change" to achieve this
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1. I stated that the purpose of this study was to see how a user would go about adding and deleting to the table. As well as changing an entry in the table. I stated that they had no need to stress over achieving the tasks. That I would like them to think out their process of going about the tasks while they looked at the page. Then I showed them the website and allowed them to go through the process of achieving the tasks.
